# Week 3: Cloud Security  :cloud: :guardsman:

**:cloud: Cloud computing** is the delivery of hosted services, including software, hardware, and storage, over the Internet. The benefits of rapid deployment, flexibility, low up-front costs, and scalability, have made cloud computing virtually universal among organizations of all sizes, often as part of a hybrid/multi-cloud infrastructure architecture.

Cloud security refers to the technologies, policies, controls, and services that protect cloud data, applications, and infrastructure from threats.

## `What is Infrastructure as a Service?` 

The term Infrastructure as a Service, or IaaS (also, occasionally called Hardware as a Service), falls within the subject area of Cloud Computing and is sometimes accompanied by the terms Platform as a Service (PaaS) and Software as a Service (SaaS).  

Infrastructure as a Service describes a model where organizations outsource hardware requirements such as database storage, networking components, servers, and database/server virtualization to an outside vendor . The organization will often pay on a per-use basis meaning the vendor charges based on actual storage space used in conjunction with data transmission rates.   The vendor provides the equipment and is responsible for its maintenance which typically offers dynamic scalability as the purchasing organization’s hardware requirements increase.  

Infrastructure as a Service means the companies can focus on creating applications without incurring the upfront costs of purchasing and maintaining underutilized hardware.

**Infrastructure as a service (IaaS)** is a form of cloud computing that provides virtualized computing resources over the internet. IaaS is one of the three main categories of cloud computing services, alongside software as a service (SaaS) and platform as a service (PaaS).

In the _IaaS model_, the cloud provider manages IT infrastructures such as storage, server and networking resources, and delivers them to subscriber organizations via virtual machines accessible through the internet. IaaS can have many benefits for organizations, such as potentially making workloads faster, easier, more flexible and more cost efficient.
IaaS architecture

In an _IaaS_ service model, a cloud provider hosts the infrastructure components that are traditionally present in an on-premises data center. This includes servers, storage and networking hardware, as well as the **virtualization** or **hypervisor** layer.

The following diagram shows a simplified view of the 3 main layers of cloud computing and how each layer builds upon the one which precedes it.  

![layers of cloud computing](https://www.modernanalyst.com/Portals/0/images/iaas-paas-saas.jpg)

    Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS).
    Platform as a Service (PaaS).
    Software as a Service (SaaS). 

## (PaaS):
**Platform as a service (PaaS)** is a cloud computing model where a third-party provider delivers hardware and software tools to users over the internet.

SaaS, PaaS and IaaS present three modern but different ways to describe how you can use the cloud for your business. 

It is important to remember that most businesses using cloud-based platforms use a combination of SaaS and IaaS cloud computing service models, and many engage developers to create applications using PaaS, too.
SaaS

SaaS platforms involve software that is available via third-party over the Internet. 

Examples of popular SaaS providers include: 

    BigCommerce.
    Google Workspace, Salesforce.
    Dropbox.
    MailChimp.
    ZenDesk.
    DocuSign.
    Slack.
    Hubspot. 

PaaS

PaaS focuses primarily on hardware and software tools available over the internet. 

Examples of popular PaaS providers include: 

    AWS Elastic Beanstalk.
    Heroku.
    Windows Azure (mainly used as PaaS).
    Force.com.
    Google App Engine.
    OpenShift.
    Apache Stratos.
    Adobe Magento Commerce Cloud. 

IaaS

IaaS works primarily with cloud-based and pay-as-you-go services such as storage, networking and virtualization.

Examples of popular IaaS providers include: 

    AWS EC2.
    Rackspace.
    Google Compute Engine (GCE).
    Digital Ocean.
    Microsoft Azure.
    Magento 1 Enterprise Edition*. 

The 3 Types of Cloud Computing Service Models Explained
1. IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service).

IaaS, also known as cloud infrastructure services, provides end users with cloud-based alternatives to on-premise, physical infrastructure, allowing businesses to purchase resources on-demand instead of the more costly venture of having to buy and manage hardware.
IaaS characteristics.

IaaS is scalable and offers businesses greater flexibility than on-premise solutions through the cloud. IaaS businesses typically provide services such as pay-as-you-go storage, networking and virtualization.

IaaS cloud servers are typically offered to businesses over the internet, whether through a dashboard or an API, ensuring users have complete control over their computing infrastructure.

IaaS platforms are:

    Highly flexible and highly scalable.
    Accessible by multiple users.
    Cost-effective. 

IaaS advantages.

Maintaining on-premise IT infrastructure can be costly and labor-intensive as it often requires a significant initial investment in physical hardware. You will also probably need to engage skilled external IT contractors to maintain the hardware and keep everything working and up-to-date.

With IaaS, you can buy what you need, as you need it, and purchase more as your business grows.

IaaS solutions are highly flexible and scalable and can be replaced whenever needed without losing money on your initial investment.

Another advantage of IaaS is it puts control over the infrastructure back in your hands. You will no longer need to place trust in an external IT contractor — you can access and oversee IaaS products yourself if you wish, without being an IT wiz.
IaaS disadvantages.

There are certain limitations and concerns when it comes to transitioning to IaaS, including:

    Legacy systems: Before a full migration to the cloud is completed, any legacy technology or applications should be reviewed for compatibility. There are many older systems that are not designed for cloud-based services and may need to be upgraded or replaced. 
    Security: With the move from on-premise to the cloud, there could be new security threats, whether sources from the host or other virtual machines (VMs). It is critical that organizations review and research up-to-date security threats and their remediation strategies. 
    Internal Training: With a new system comes a lack of familiarity with its intricacies. Businesses should prepare additional training and resources to ensure their users know what they are doing.

## :question: When to use IaaS :question:

IaaS is beneficial to businesses of all shapes and sizes. It allows complete control over your infrastructure and operates on a pay-as-you-use model, which fits into most budgets.

With most IaaS platforms, you get access to ongoing support and have the option of scaling up your requirements at any time.

Utilizing IaaS is an excellent way to future-proof your business.
IaaS non-ecommerce example.

A good example of IaaS is AWS EC2.

EC2 delivers scalable infrastructure for companies that want to host cloud-based applications. EC2 users do not own the physical servers — AWS provides virtual servers.

Users only pay for the usage of the servers, saving them the cost — and associated ongoing maintenance — of investing in physical hardware.
IaaS ecommerce example.

Adobe Commerce (Magento) can be used either on-premise or IaaS, depending on how the merchant chooses to host their store.

In the case of IaaS, the merchant is paying Magento for the licensing of the software and then using a third-party vendor for the best web hosting such as Rackspace.

Merchants are able to pay for a hosting plan that meets their own needs without the cost of maintaining their own physical servers. The merchant is still responsible for installing and managing updates to their Magento software.
2. PaaS (Platform as a Service).

PaaS, also known as cloud platform services, provides developers with a framework, software and tools needed to build apps and software — all accessible through the internet. 

Often seen as a scaled-down version of IaaS, PaaS gives its customers broader access to servers, storage and networking, all managed by a third-party provider.
PaaS characteristics.

PaaS delivery is comparable to SaaS methods, with the main difference being that customers are not able to access online software but an online platform. 

PaaS provides that platform for software developers to create, allowing them to concentrate on the software itself instead of any external issues. 

PaaS platforms are:

    Accessible by multiple users.
    Scalable — customers can choose from various tiers of computing resources to suit the size of their business.
    Built on virtualization technology.
    Easy to run without extensive system administration knowledge. 

PaaS advantages.

PaaS is primarily used by developers who are building software or applications.

A PaaS solution provides the platform for developers to create unique, customizable software meaning that developers don’t need to start from scratch when developing applications — saving them time and money on writing extensive code.

PaaS is a popular choice for businesses who want to create unique applications without spending a fortune or taking on all the responsibility. It’s similar to the difference between hiring a venue to put on a show vs. building one yourself to put on a show.

The venue stays the same, but what you create in that space is unique.
PaaS disadvantages.

Like IaaS, there are certain drawbacks to using PaaS that companies should be aware of, including: 

    Integrations: With PaaS, you may encounter challenges when integrating new applications. This is tied into issues related to legacy systems since there are often aspects of these systems that aren’t built for the cloud. 
    Data security: Using third-party servers for your data could potentially lead to additional security risks. Security options may also be limited since you will have to find a solution that can integrate with the third-party systems.
    Runtime: PaaS solutions may not be fully optimized for the language and frameworks your business uses and finding a specifically tailored solution may be difficult. 
    Operational limitations: Customized cloud operations may not be compatible with PaaS solutions, especially those with management automation workflows. This can inhibit your operational capabilities and limit the full scope of your business.  

:question: When to use PaaS. :question:

PaaS is often the most cost-effective and time-effective way for a developer to create a unique application.

PaaS allows the developer to focus on the creative side of app development as opposed to the menial tasks such as managing software updates or security patches. Instead, their time and brainpower can go into creating, testing and deploying the app.
PaaS non-ecommerce example.

A good example of PaaS is AWS Elastic Beanstalk.

Amazon Web Services (AWS) offers over 200 cloud computing services such as EC2, RDS, and S3. Most of these services can be used as IaaS, and most companies who use AWS will pick and choose the services they need.

However, managing multiple services can quickly become difficult and time-consuming for users. 

That’s where AWS Elastic Beanstalk comes in. It works as another layer on top of the infrastructure services and automatically handles the details of capacity provisioning, load balancing, scalability, and application health monitoring.
PaaS ecommerce example.

Adobe Commerce (Magento) is the most common example of PaaS for ecommerce. It enables the merchant to bundle their hosting as part of their package with Magento.

Merchants evaluating Magento go through a scoping process to determine their hosting needs, bundled into their monthly plan. You will have full access to edit the source code of their Magento store and can fully customize the application.

Any platform updates, security patches and general maintenance to their store would be the merchant's responsibility.
3. SaaS (Software as a Service).

SaaS, also known as cloud application services, is the most commonly used service within the cloud market. SaaS platforms make software available to users over the internet, usually for a monthly subscription fee.

They are typically ready-to-use and run from a users’ web browser, which allows businesses to skip any additional downloads or application installations. 
SaaS characteristics.

SaaS is delivered through the internet as a full functional service, accessible via any web browser. With SaaS, vendors manage the data, servers and storage, ultimately eliminating the need for IT review and streamlining business processes.

SaaS platforms are:

    Available over the Internet.
    Hosted on a remote server by a third-party provider.
    Ideal for small businesses or startups who cannot develop their own software applications.
    Scalable, with different tiers for small, medium and enterprise-level businesses.
    Inclusive, offering security, compliance and maintenance as part of the cost. 

SaaS advantages.

With SaaS, you don’t need to install and run software applications on your computer. Everything is available over the internet when you log in to your account online. You can usually access the software from any device, anytime — as long as there is an internet connection.

The same goes for anyone else using the software. All your staff will have personalized logins suitable to their access level. You no longer need to engage an IT specialist to download the software onto multiple computers throughout your office or worry about keeping up-to-date software on every computer. It’s all taken care of in the Cloud.

**Another key advantage is the payment structure.**

Most SaaS providers operate a subscription model with a fixed, inclusive monthly account fee. You know precisely how much the software will cost and can budget accordingly without worrying about hidden surprises.

Subscriptions can potentially include maintenance, compliance and security services. SaaS providers also offer out-of-the-box, simple solutions to set up if you need a basic package, with more complex solutions for larger organizations. You could have the basic software up and running within a matter of hours – and you’ll have access to customer service and support along the way.
SaaS disadvantages.

Like IaaS and PaaS, there are limitations and concerns about SaaS, including:

    Data Security: With data primarily located in off-premise servers, security could potentially become an issue. Ensure that you have the right security solutions in place and are comfortable with whichever SaaS service you are using. 
    Interoperability: Integrations with existing applications and services can be a concern since many SaaS apps are not designed for open integrations. Finding a service with integration capabilities can be difficult, and attempting to create your own can be worse. 
    Customization: SaaS services typically allow minimal customization for features, capabilities and integrations. This can force companies to invest significant resources into managing or adding customization capabilities. 
    Lack of control: With a SaaS solution, businesses often have to hand over ultimate control to the third-party service providers — giving them the keys to functionality, performance and even data. You will want to ensure that you trust the provider used or have the ability to review your information remotely.

:question: When to use SaaS :question:

SaaS platforms are ideal for when you want an application to run smoothly and reliably with minimal input from you.

Take your email server, for example.

You want to know that you can continue to send and receive emails without needing to fiddle with your email settings or worry about updates. Imagine if your email server went under because you forgot to update it? That’s simply not an option in today’s marketplace.

If you use SaaS applications to run your email inbox, the chances of something going wrong are very small, and if something did go wrong, it would be up to the SaaS provider to find a solution.

You’re not only paying for the SaaS applications/products — you’re paying for peace of mind.
SaaS non-ecommerce example.

Google Workspace — formerly known as Google G Suite — is one of the most popular SaaS-based infrastructure services. The upgrade from G Suite came as a result of a more integrated experience across Google’s broader suite, which allowed its customers to better connect with their various tools. 

The Google Workspace suite features applications people are aware of, such as Gmail, Google Calendar, Google Docs and more.
SaaS ecommerce example.

An excellent example of a SaaS ecommerce platform is BigCommerce.

BigCommerce is one of the leading SaaS ecommerce platforms for mid-market and enterprise brands. It has all the benefits associated with multi-tenant SaaS — ease of use, high-performance, and continuous updates — coupled with platform-wide APIs that enable businesses to customize their sites and integrate with external applications and services.  

BigCommerce provides complete shopping cart software and hosting infrastructure to the user, allowing businesses to create an online shop within minutes without worrying about coding, hosting or software.

The BigCommerce platform also has regular updates that automatically roll out for users, and software licenses, upgrades, and hosting costs are all covered in the monthly subscription fee.

Ultimately, what are the differences between IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS?

    IaaS is there to provide you with maximum flexibility when it comes to hosting custom-built apps, as well as providing a general data center for data storage.
    PaaS is most often built on top of an IaaS platform to reduce the need for system administration. It allows you to focus on app development instead of infrastructure management.
    SaaS offers ready-to-use, out-of-the-box solutions that meet a particular business need (such as a website or email). Most modern SaaS platforms are built on IaaS or PaaS platforms. 

The increasing popularity of IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS has reduced the need for on-premise hosting. As businesses and technology continue to merge, migrating to the cloud becomes paramount for organizations looking to remain on the cutting edge.

These cloud delivery models give users choices, flexibility and options that on-premise hosting simply cannot provide.

## What differentiates PaaS from SaaS? :question:

The most significant difference between PaaS and SaaS is that SaaS products are fully managed by another company, from the servers to the data itself. With PaaS, you are able to use the cloud-based platform as a foundation for building software. 

If you want to create your own applications for your business, then PaaS platforms are the best option.
What is the difference between IaaS and PaaS?

The greatest difference between IaaS and PaaS comes from who controls the system. 

With IaaS, administrators gain more direct control over operating systems. On the other hand, users gain greater flexibility and control over proprietary applications or programs with PaaS.

## How does the SaaS model differ from the IaaS model? :question:

With both IaaS and SaaS, the cloud service providers manage servers, networking, virtualization and storage. 

However, unlike SaaS, those who use IaaS are still responsible for managing some aspects of their business, including applications, runtime, middleware and data. SaaS is the more out-of-the-box option, while IaaS maintains a small level of control. 

## Cloud Security is a Shared Responsibility

Cloud security is a responsibility that is shared between the cloud provider and the customer. There are basically three categories of responsibilities in the Shared Responsibility Model: responsibilities that are always the provider’s, responsibilities that are always the customer’s, and responsibilities that vary depending on the service model: Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), or Software as a Service (SaaS), such as cloud email.

The security responsibilities that are always the provider’s are related to the safeguarding of the infrastructure itself, as well as access to, patching, and configuration of the physical hosts and the physical network on which the compute instances run and the storage and other resources reside.

The security responsibilities that are always the customer’s include managing users and their access privileges (identity and access management), the safeguarding of cloud accounts from unauthorized access, the encryption and protection of cloud-based data assets, and managing its security posture (compliance).
The Top 7 Advanced Cloud Security Challenges

Because the public cloud does not have clear perimeters, it presents a fundamentally different security reality. This becomes even more challenging when adopting modern cloud approaches such as automated Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) methods, distributed serverless architectures, and ephemeral assets like Functions as a Service and containers.

### Some of the advanced cloud-native security challenges and the multiple layers of risk faced by today’s cloud-oriented organizations include:

    Increased Attack Surface

    The public cloud environment has become a large and highly attractive attack surface for hackers who exploit poorly secured cloud ingress ports in order to access and disrupt workloads and data in the cloud. Malware, Zero-Day, Account Takeover and many other malicious threats have become a day-to-day reality.
    Lack of Visibility and Tracking

    In the IaaS model, the cloud providers have full control over the infrastructure layer and do not expose it to their customers. The lack of visibility and control is further extended in the PaaS and SaaS cloud models. Cloud customers often cannot effectively identify and quantify their cloud assets or visualize their cloud environmets.
    Ever-Changing Workloads

    Cloud assets are provisioned and decommissioned dynamically—at scale and at velocity. Traditional security tools are simply incapable of enforcing protection policies in such a flexible and dynamic environment with its ever-changing and ephemeral workloads.
    DevOps, DevSecOps and Automation

    Organizations that have embraced the highly automated DevOps CI/CD culture must ensure that appropriate security controls are identified and embedded in code and templates early in the development cycle. Security-related changes implemented after a workload has been deployed in production can undermine the organization’s security posture as well as lengthen time to market.
    Granular Privilege and Key Management

    Often cloud user roles are configured very loosely, granting extensive privileges beyond what is intended or required. One common example is giving database delete or write permissions to untrained users or users who have no business need to delete or add database assets. At the application level, improperly configured keys and privileges expose sessions to security risks.
    Complex Environments

    Managing security in a consistent way in the hybrid and multicloud environments favored by enterprises these days requires methods and tools that work seamlessly across public cloud providers, private cloud providers, and on-premise deployments—including branch office edge protection for geographically distributed organizations.
    Cloud Compliance and Governance

    All the leading cloud providers have aligned themselves with most of the well-known accreditation programs such as PCI 3.2, NIST 800-53, HIPAA and GDPR. 
    However, customers are responsible for ensuring that their workload and data processes are compliant.
    Given the poor visibility as well as the dynamics of the cloud environment, the compliance audit process becomes close to mission impossible unless tools are used to achieve continuous compliance checks and issue real-time alerts about misconfigurations.

## Zero Trust and Why You Should Embrace It

The term Zero Trust was first introduced in 2010 by John Kindervag who, at that time, was a senior Forrester Research analyst. The basic principle of Zero Trust in cloud security is not to automatically trust anyone or anything within or outside of the network—and verify (i.e., authorize, inspect and secure) everything.

Zero Trust, for example, promotes a least privilege governance strategy whereby users are only given access to the resources they need to perform their duties. Similarly, it calls upon developers to ensure that web-facing applications are properly secured.  For example, if the developer has not blocked ports consistently or has not implemented permissions on an “as needed” basis, a hacker who takes over the application will have privileges to retrieve and modify data from the database.

In addition, Zero Trust networks utilize micro-segmentation to make cloud network security far more granular. Micro-segmentation creates secure zones in data centers and cloud deployments thereby segmenting workloads from each other, securing everything inside the zone, and applying policies to secure traffic between zones.
The 6 Pillars of Robust Cloud Security

While cloud providers such as Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure (Azure), and Google Cloud Platform (GCP) offer many cloud native security features and services, supplementary third-party solutions are essential to achieve enterprise-grade cloud workload protection from breaches, data leaks, and targeted attacks in the cloud environment. Only an integrated cloud-native/third-party security stack provides the centralized visibility and policy-based granular control necessary to deliver the following industry best practices:

    Granular, policy-based IAM and authentication controls across complex infrastructures

    Work with groups and roles rather than at the individual IAM level to make it easier to update IAM definitions as business requirements change.
    Grant only the minimal access privileges to assets and APIs that are essential for a group or role to carry out its tasks. The more extensive privileges,
    the higher the levels of authentication. And don’t neglect good IAM hygiene, enforcing strong password policies, permission time-outs, and so on.
    Zero-trust cloud network security controls across logically isolated networks and micro-segments

    Deploy business-critical resources and apps in logically isolated sections of the provider’s cloud network, such as Virtual Private Clouds (AWS and Google) 
    or vNET (Azure).
    Use subnets to micro-segment workloads from each other, with granular security policies at subnet gateways. Use dedicated WAN links in hybrid architectures,
    and use static user-defined routing configurations to customize access to virtual devices, 
    virtual networks and their gateways, and public IP addresses.
    Enforcement of virtual server protection policies and processes such as change management and software updates:

    Cloud security vendors provide robust Cloud Security Posture Management, consistently applying governance and compliance rules and templates 
    when provisioning virtual servers, auditing for configuration deviations, and remediating automatically where possible.
    Safeguarding all applications (and especially cloud-native distributed apps) with a next-generation web application firewall

    This will granularly inspect and control traffic to and from web application servers, automatically updates WAF rules in response to traffic behavior changes,
    and is deployed closer to microservices that are running workloads.
    Enhanced data protection

    Enhanced data protection with encryption at all transport layers, secure file shares and communications, continuous compliance risk management, 
    and maintaining good data storage resource hygiene such as detecting misconfigured buckets and terminating orphan resources.
    Threat intelligence that detects and remediates known and unknown threats in real-time

    Third-party cloud security vendors add context to the large and diverse streams of cloud-native logs by intelligently 
    cross-referencing aggregated log data with internal data such as asset and configuration management systems, vulnerability scanners, etc. 
    and external data such as public threat intelligence feeds, geolocation databases, etc. They also provide tools that help visualize
    and query the threat landscape and promote quicker incident response times. 
    AI-based anomaly detection algorithms are applied to catch unknown threats, which then undergo forensics analysis to determine their risk profile. 
    Real-time alerts on intrusions and policy violations shorten times to remediation, sometimes even triggering auto-remediation workflows.

 across all the pillars of cloud security: access control, network security, virtual server compliance, workload and data protection, and threat intelligence.
