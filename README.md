### In this repo, there are my assignments, notes and some files I utilized during the Bootcamp. I will check the repo and _make it better for future bootcamp students by adding other files, my other notes_ 
- (first I need to convert markdown and upload pdf versions for convience and check the Schedule and Coursera Course Weeks... **for now**, _it is not fully synchronized_)

### I also added my assignments and quizzes to give an idea for future students if this *Picus Security Bootcamp* is arranged in the ffollowing years.
