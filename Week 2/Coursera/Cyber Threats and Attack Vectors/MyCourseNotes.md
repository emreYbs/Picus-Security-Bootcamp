# "Cyber Threats and Attack Vectors" Course on Coursera
## WEEK 1: Authentication based attacks

There are four common factors used for authentication:

    Something you know (such as a password)

    Something you have (such as a smart card)

    Something you are (such as a fingerprint or other biometric method)

    Something you do (such as voice pattern, handwriting)

## WEEK 2: Network and system based attacks

There's really two different kinds of attacks.There's active attacks and there's passive attacks.
**Active attacks** are _much more common_, because we're trying to get information real time. 

Passive attacks are when an attacker can read the data
from an active attack and use the information obtained for other purposes.
In active attacks we see this in sniffing, eavesdropping,
spoofing and denial of service attacks,
whereas passive attacks, what is seen there is more compromised data.
So password manipulation for example.
Let's dive into each one of these.

Our first active attack is going to be sniffing.
Sniffing is the most common type of active attack.
It is reading, monitoring or capturing the full packets from a network device.
So that could be from a computer,
that could be from a switch or a router or other,
well, it could be from a webcam.

Segmenting your network is one of the simplest ways that you can use to protect yourself,
because then we're only sniffing a small segment of information.
Protecting your network physically is also something that you need to do.
If we have physical access to a piece of equipment,
we may be able to break-in via console cable or something like that and guess
the username and password
for that piece of networking equipment and use that against somebody.

If you were a small business or an individual that cannot
afford to purchase enterprise grade hardware,
understand who is on your network.
Understand who is using your network.
Don't allow outsiders to connect to your private networks.
This is especially the case in wireless networks.
